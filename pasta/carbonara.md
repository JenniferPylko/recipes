# Carbonara

<meta property="og:description" content="Most carbonara recipes overcomplicate the dish or curdle the egg yolks, but not this one."

## Ingredients

- 8 egg yolks
- 8 oz grated pecorino romano (my preference), parmigiano reggiano, or other hard Italian cheese
- 6 servings fettuccine or other pasta
- 0.5 lb pancetta
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 4 cloves garlic (optional, non-traditional)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice (optional, non-traditional)

## Materials

- Cooking pot
- Spoon or whisk
- Mixing bowl
- Tongs

## Procedure

- Set aside a small amount of cheese to sprinkle on top.
- Strain the egg yolks.
- Blend the egg yolks, lemon juice, black pepper, and cheese into a paste.
- Mince the garlic.
- Dice the pancetta.
- Fry the pancetta with the garlic.
- Cook the fettuccine.
- Drain the fettuccine, setting aside 1-2 cups of the pasta water when it's done.
- Add pasta water slowly to the egg and cheese, stirring continuously. Add plenty so that the sauce is a little thinner than your desired final product.
- Add the egg sauce and pancetta to the fettuccine, mixing with tongs to coat the pasta.
- Top each serving with the remaining cheese.

## Presentation

This dish is best served in a white bowl to highlight the deep yellow color the egg yolks bring.
